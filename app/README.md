# 🌪️ Early Disaster Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is an intelligent system that predicts natural disasters early using historical data and machine learning models. It helps alert people before the disaster hits and supports emergency planning.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Predict disasters like floods, earthquakes, and wildfires based on user input
- ✅ User-friendly GUI using **Tkinter**
- ✅ Real-time alert sound notification
- ✅ PDF report generation of predictions
- ✅ Weather API Integration (optional)
- ✅ Clean & Modular Python Code

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User enters specific inputs related to disaster parameters (like temperature, pressure, humidity, etc.)
2. The ML model predicts whether a disaster may occur.
3. GUI displays prediction result with alert (if disaster is likely).
4. Option to generate a PDF report and trigger sound alert.
